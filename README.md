# Xylophone
# Description
This is a mini project that mimics a xylophone, playing seven notes of the music C,D,E,F,G,A,B. This is part of Angela Yu's IOS Development bootcamp and I have added a feature to change the opacity of the button when clicked to make it visible to the user to see that the button functions.
